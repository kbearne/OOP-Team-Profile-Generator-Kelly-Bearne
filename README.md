# OOP-Team-Profile-Generator-Kelly-Bearne

## Description

This Node.js command-line application takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person so that a manager can quickly access employees emails and GitHub profiles.

It is built using OOP principles and includes a Jest test suite. 

The codebase follows best practice throughout (e.g. class / ID naming conventions, indentation and quality comments) as well as basic JavaScript error catching.
